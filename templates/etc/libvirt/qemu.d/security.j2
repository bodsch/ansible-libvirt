# The default security driver is SELinux. If SELinux is disabled
# on the host, then the security driver will automatically disable
# itself. If you wish to disable QEMU SELinux security driver while
# leaving SELinux enabled for the host in general, then set this
# to 'none' instead. It's also possible to use more than one security
# driver at the same time, for this use a list of names separated by
# comma and delimited by square brackets. For example:
#
#       security_driver = [ "selinux", "apparmor" ]
#
# Notes: The DAC security driver is always enabled; as a result, the
# value of security_driver cannot contain "dac".  The value "none" is
# a special value; security_driver can be set to that value in
# isolation, but it cannot appear in a list of drivers.
#
#security_driver = "selinux"

# If set to non-zero, then the default security labeling
# will make guests confined. If set to zero, then guests
# will be unconfined by default. Defaults to 1.
#security_default_confined = 1

# If set to non-zero, then attempts to create unconfined
# guests will be blocked. Defaults to 0.
#security_require_confined = 1
