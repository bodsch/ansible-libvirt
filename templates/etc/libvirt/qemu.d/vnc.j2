# VNC is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1 by default.
# To make it listen on all public interfaces, uncomment
# this next option.

# NB, strong recommendation to enable TLS + x509 certificate
# verification when allowing public access

#vnc_listen = "0.0.0.0"

# Enable this option to have VNC served over an automatically created
# unix socket. This prevents unprivileged access from users on the
# host machine, though most VNC clients do not support it.
#
# This will only be enabled for VNC configurations that have listen
# type=address but without any address specified. This setting takes
# preference over vnc_listen.
#

# Enable use of TLS encryption on the VNC server. This requires
# a VNC client which supports the VeNCrypt protocol extension.
# Examples include vinagre, virt-viewer, virt-manager and vencrypt
# itself. UltraVNC, RealVNC, TightVNC do not support this
#
# It is necessary to setup CA and issue a server certificate
# before enabling this.

#vnc_tls = 1


# In order to override the default TLS certificate location for
# vnc certificates, supply a valid path to the certificate directory.
# If the provided path does not exist, libvirtd will fail to start.
# If the path is not provided, but vnc_tls = 1, then the
# default_tls_x509_cert_dir path will be used.

#vnc_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/pki/libvirt-vnc"


# Uncomment and use the following option to override the default secret
# UUID provided in the default_tls_x509_secret_uuid parameter.
#
#vnc_tls_x509_secret_uuid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"


# The default TLS configuration only uses certificates for the server
# allowing the client to verify the server's identity and establish
# an encrypted channel.
#
# It is possible to use x509 certificates for authentication too, by
# issuing an x509 certificate to every client who needs to connect.
#
# Enabling this option will reject any client that does not have a
# certificate (as described in default_tls_x509_verify) signed by the
# CA in the vnc_tls_x509_cert_dir (or default_tls_x509_cert_dir).
#
# If this option is not supplied, it will be set to the value of
# "default_tls_x509_verify". If "default_tls_x509_verify" is not supplied either,
# the default is "0".

# The default VNC password. Only 8 bytes are significant for
# VNC passwords. This parameter is only used if the per-domain
# XML config does not already provide a password. To allow
# access without passwords, leave this commented out. An empty
# string will still enable passwords, but be rejected by QEMU,
# effectively preventing any use of VNC. Obviously change this
# example here before you set this.
#
#vnc_password = "XYZ12345"


# Enable use of SASL encryption on the VNC server. This requires
# a VNC client which supports the SASL protocol extension.
# Examples include vinagre, virt-viewer and virt-manager
# itself. UltraVNC, RealVNC, TightVNC do not support this
#
# It is necessary to configure /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf to choose
# the desired SASL plugin (eg, GSSPI for Kerberos)
#
#vnc_sasl = 1


# The default SASL configuration file is located in /etc/sasl2/
# When running libvirtd unprivileged, it may be desirable to
# override the configs in this location. Set this parameter to
# point to the directory, and create a qemu.conf in that location
#
#vnc_sasl_dir = "/some/directory/sasl2"


# QEMU implements an extension for providing audio over a VNC connection,
# though if your VNC client does not support it, your only chance for getting
# sound output is through regular audio backends. By default, libvirt will
# disable all QEMU sound backends if using VNC, since they can cause
# permissions issues. Enabling this option will make libvirtd honor the
# QEMU_AUDIO_DRV environment variable when using VNC.
