# In order to override the default TLS certificate location for migration
# certificates, supply a valid path to the certificate directory. If the
# provided path does not exist, libvirtd will fail to start. If the path is
# not provided, but TLS-encrypted migration is requested, then the
# default_tls_x509_cert_dir path will be used. Once/if a default certificate is
# enabled/defined, migration will then be able to use the certificate via
# migration API flags.

# The default TLS configuration only uses certificates for the server
# allowing the client to verify the server's identity and establish
# an encrypted channel.
#
# It is possible to use x509 certificates for authentication too, by
# issuing an x509 certificate to every client who needs to connect.
#
# Enabling this option will reject any client that does not have a
# certificate (as described in default_tls_x509_verify) signed by the
# CA in the migrate_tls_x509_cert_dir (or default_tls_x509_cert_dir).
#
# If this option is not supplied, it will be set to the value of
# "default_tls_x509_verify". If "default_tls_x509_verify" is not supplied
# either, the default is "1".

# Uncomment and use the following option to override the default secret
# UUID provided in the default_tls_x509_secret_uuid parameter.
#
# NB This default all-zeros UUID will not work. Replace it with the
# output from the UUID for the TLS secret from a 'virsh secret-list'
# command and then uncomment the entry

# By default TLS is requested using the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag, thus not requested
# automatically. Setting 'migate_tls_force' to "1" will prevent any migration
# which is not using VIR_MIGRATE_TLS to ensure higher level of security in
# deployments with TLS.
