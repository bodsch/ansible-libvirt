# Keepalive protocol:
# This allows qemu driver to detect broken connections to remote
# libvirtd during peer-to-peer migration.  A keepalive message is
# sent to the daemon after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity
# to check if the daemon is still responding; keepalive_count is a
# maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent
# to the daemon without getting any response before the connection
# is considered broken.  In other words, the connection is
# automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the daemon.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, qemu driver will not send keepalive requests during
# peer-to-peer migration; however, the remote libvirtd can still
# send them and source libvirtd will send responses.  When
# keepalive_count is set to 0, connections will be automatically
# closed after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity without
# sending any keepalive messages.
